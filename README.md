# blogsnip

A package of [RStudio addins](https://rstudio.github.io/rstudioaddins/) to insert code snippets into [Blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) posts.

These are snippets that make my life easier when writing blog posts in R Markdown for [rostrum.blog](https://rostrum.blog). You may or may not find them useful.

The package will be updated over time with new addins as I see fit.

Feel free to [add or suggest new snippets](https://github.com/matt-dray/blogsnip/issues).
