# blogsnip

## What

A package of [RStudio addins](https://rstudio.github.io/rstudioaddins/) to insert code snippets into [{blogdown}](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) posts.

These snippets make my life easier when writing blog posts for [rostrum.blog](https://rostrum.blog). You may or may not find them useful. The package will be updated over time with new addins as I see fit.

This repo is [available as a website](https://matt-dray.github.io/blogsnip/), thanks to [{pkgdown}](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/). You can read about each addin on [the 'references' page](https://matt-dray.github.io/blogsnip/reference/index.html).

## Install

Install with:

```
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("matt-dray/blogsnip")
```

The addins will then be available from the 'Addins' menu in RStudio, listed under 'BLOGSNIP'.
