# Purpose

{blogsnip} is a small, personal collection of functions that make it easier for me to write my {blogdown} posts for [rostrum.blog](https://www.rostrum.blog){target="_blank"} in R Markdown. They generally insert code snippets or modify strings highlighted by the user.

{blogsnip} is designed to operate as an [RStudio Addin](https://rstudio.github.io/rstudioaddins/){target="_blank"}. This means its functions can be accessed from the dedicated Addins dropdown menu in the RStudio GUI and each can be mapped to a keyboard shortcut.

I later learned about--and can definitely recommend--[ThinkR's {remedy} package](https://github.com/ThinkR-open/remedy){target="_blank"} for inserting other, basic R Markdown snippets.

# Install

{blogsnip} isn't on CRAN and it probably never will be. Install from GitHub with {remotes}.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("matt-dray/blogsnip")
```

The {blogsnip} functions will then appear in the 'BLOGSNIP' section of the 'Addins' menu of RStudio. Restart RStudio if they don't appear immediately.
